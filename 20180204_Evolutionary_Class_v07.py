    The populaion consits of a specified number of creatures (another class) which have certain attributs called chromosomes.
    Chromosomes are the parameters, you want to have optimized for your problem.
    Initially the creatures are initialized with random values for the coromosomes within chromosome specific min/max values.
    The evolutionary process consists of the following steps:
        0. Initialize the population
        1. Measure each creatures fitness with a fitness function (usually by 'observing' the behaviour of each creature in a simulation and rating it with a fitness score (positive integer), this has to be done outside of this class by your specification)
        2. Select two parents from the population to 'produce' an offspring, the chance of getting picked scales with the creatures fitness-value
        3. Cros-Over the chromosomes of the 'mother' and 'father' creature to generate the offspring
        4. Randomly apply mutation (add or subtract random value) to the childs chomosomes
        5. Replace a creature from the current population, lower fittnes-value creatures have higher chances of getting picked
    Repeat step 1-5 until the best creature either is fit enough to meet your criteria or the set amount of evolution-epocs is over.
    Finally pick the best creatures chromosomes, these are your optimized values.
